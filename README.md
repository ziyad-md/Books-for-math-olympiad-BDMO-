## What this repository about??
Here I have given a list of some books for those ones who want's to prepare for math olympiad. I have participated BDMO-2021 Selection and regional round and I know the importance of book for math olympiad. These books are very popular for preparing math olympiad and they good also. Many of us have confusion about which books should I read for preparing math olympiad? You can read these books and I think they will be enough for selection, regional and national round. They will also help you for IMO(Basics).
